CS 6210 Project 1

To build, simply type "make". To build with debugging symbols
enabled, giving a detailed print out of the execution, type "make
debug". To clean the compiled files, type "make clean".

The project was laid out by Eclipse, so there are parallel
"Release" and "Debug" directories for each build target, each
with their own makefile. The source for the user-level threads
library is in gtthreads/ and a sample application linking to it
is in gtmatrix/.
